# MovieProject

This is just a small project to show off basic Django knowledge. This is just a list of some of my favorite movies. Clicking a movie will show a detailed view of the movie.

To run either clone or download the project on your computer, open it in an IDE, and then run it. 
If you don't have a "Run Task" setup just open a terminal and type in this command:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
Once it is running either click the link or go to the address in your web browser.

If you would like to add a movie type /admin after the site address
- username is colin
- password is secret
